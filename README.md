# LSES V1.0: Large Scale Evolution Simulator
This simulator is called LSES. Which stands for Large Scale Evolution Simulator. Creatures live on a procedurally generated plane of 100x100 tiles. Each creature has 6 input sensors. 2 which can detect food on the tiles. 4 which can detect hue and distance of other creatures in their surroundings. The input also contains 2 input memory neurons which get previous brain state memory output. The output to the creature includes, forward velocity, angluar velocity, mouth color, body color, eating value, birth value, spike leght and 2 memory output. Users can save and load simualtion states with funtional UI. Users can also change large varity of hyper-parameter values for differnt sumulation runs.
